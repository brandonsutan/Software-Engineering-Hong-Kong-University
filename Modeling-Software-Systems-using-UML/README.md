# Course 1: Software Engineering: Modeling Software Systems using UML

This directory contains all my coursework, including notes, assignments, and project work for the first course in the Software Engineering Specialization titled "Software Engineering: Modeling Software Systems using UML" offered by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

## Course Overview

This course took approximately 28 hours to complete and provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), specifically focusing on the requirements analysis phase. The key tool for this course was the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which served as a fundamental skill in visualizing and documenting software system design.

## What I Learned

- **Understanding of SDLC:** Gained a solid grasp of the SDLC phases, especially on requirements gathering and analysis.
- **Proficiency in UML:** Learned to use UML as a visual modeling language to capture and articulate system requirements.
- **Domain Modeling:** Created domain models to describe the key concepts, associations, and constraints within the application domain.
- **Use-Case Modeling:** Developed use-case models to outline the interactions between the system and its environment including users and other systems.
- **Best Practices in OOP:** Applied object-oriented programming concepts to understand and implement UML models.

## Reflection

This course has significantly enhanced my ability to think abstractly about software systems and has provided a strong foundation in modeling, which is critical to the development of well-structured software. The skills I've acquired here are directly applicable to the real-world scenarios I may encounter as a software engineer.

## Certification

Upon completion of this course, I earned a certificate which is a testament to the skills and knowledge I have acquired.
