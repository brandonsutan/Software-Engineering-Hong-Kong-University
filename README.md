Software Engineering Specialization by HKUST
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio and documentation of my journey through the Software Engineering Specialization offered by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The specialization, instructed by Kenneth W T Leung and sponsored by Act Now Education, has enrolled over 6,590 students and is designed for individuals seeking to advance their expertise in software engineering.

Specialization Overview
The specialization is conducted in English and provides a shareable certificate upon completion, which I've proudly added to my LinkedIn profile. The curriculum is tailored to equip learners with the ability to plan, design, implement, test, and maintain software systems by mastering both theory and application.

What I've Accomplished
Throughout the specialization, I focused on various core competencies in software engineering:

Project Management: Grasping the essential tasks and responsibilities of a software project manager.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Gaining comprehensive knowledge about SDLC stages and the role of software engineering within each phase.
Software Architecture & Design: Understanding architectural patterns, design principles, and how they contribute to creating robust software systems.
Software Testing & QA: Developing proficiency in testing methodologies to ensure software quality and reliability.
Human-Computer Interaction: Exploring the user experience and interface design to enhance user interaction with software.
Research and Design: Applying research methods to design processes for innovative and effective software solutions.
Applied Learning Project
The hands-on aspect of this specialization involved applying software engineering techniques to real-life case studies and projects, simulating a realistic development environment. This required thorough planning, requirements capturing, design implementation, testing, and maintenance of large-scale software systems.

Courses in this Specialization
Course 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Course 2: Software Design and Architecture
Course 3: Software Testing and Maintenance
Note: It's recommended to follow the courses sequentially for the best learning experience.

Acknowledgments
I express my gratitude to HKUST, Instructor Kenneth W T Leung, and Act Now Education for providing this enriching learning opportunity. Also, a big thank you to all my peers and contributors who have been part of this journey.
