# HKUST Software Engineering Specialization

This repository is a comprehensive archive of the work I completed in the Software Engineering Specialization provided by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Throughout this series, I deepened my understanding of software engineering principles and applied these concepts to real-world problems.

## Specialization Summary

Offered in English and backed by Act Now Education, this specialization guided me through essential software engineering practices. I learned to manage projects, design software architectures, test and maintain systems, and incorporate human-computer interaction considerations into software solutions.

## Learning Outcomes

Here are the key areas where I developed my expertise:

- **Project Management:** Mastered the responsibilities and strategies for successful software project management.
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** Acquired a thorough understanding of each phase within the SDLC and how to apply engineering principles effectively.
- **Software Architecture & Design:** Explored design patterns and architectural frameworks critical to building robust software.
- **Software Testing & Quality Assurance:** Learned best practices for testing to ensure the reliability and performance of software products.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** Investigated the principles of HCI to create user-centric software experiences.
- **Research and Design:** Developed research methodologies to inform the design of innovative software solutions.

## Applied Learning Projects

In this specialization, I tackled several hands-on projects that emulated the challenges faced in professional software development environments. The projects ranged from initial planning and design to implementation and maintenance, providing a holistic view of the software engineering process.
