# Course 3: Software Engineering: Software Design and Project Management

Welcome to my repository for the third course in the Software Engineering Specialization - "Software Design and Project Management." This course is part of the program provided by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and available on Coursera.

## Course Overview

Over the span of 19 hours, this course guided me through the design and project management phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I explored various architectural and design patterns, and acquired skills essential for effective project planning, scheduling, and cost estimating.

## What I Learned

- **Architectural Patterns:** Studied different architectural patterns and their applicability to solve common design problems.
- **Design Patterns:** Learned about various design patterns to use in software development for creating flexible and maintainable software.
- **Project Management:** Gained insights into project planning, risk management, scheduling, and cost estimation techniques.
- **Software Architecture:** Understood how to structure a system to meet requirements and improve performance.
- **Design Principles:** Grasped the fundamental design principles for creating robust and scalable software architectures.

## Reflection

This course has been instrumental in sharpening my skills in software design and project management. The knowledge and hands-on experience I gained are critical for my growth as a software engineer.

## Certification

Upon the successful completion of this course, I was awarded a certificate, which serves as a testament to my enhanced capabilities in software design and project management.
